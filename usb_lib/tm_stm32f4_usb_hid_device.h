 * It works in USB FS or USB HS in FS mode.
 *
 * By default, library works in USB FS mode (for STM32F4-Discovery board).
 * If you want to use this on STM32F429-Discovery board, you have to activate USB HS in FS mode.
 * Activate this with lines below in your defines.h file:
 *
 * 	//Activate USB HS in FS mode
 * 	#define USE_USB_OTG_HS
 *
 * Pinout (can not be changed)
 *
 * 	USB			|STM32F4xx FS mode				|STM32F4xx HS in FS mode	|Notes
 * 				|STM32F4-Discovery				|STM32F429-Discovery
 *
 * 	Data +		PA12							PB15						Data+ for USB, standard and used pin
 * 	Data -		PA11							PB14						Data- for USB, standard and used pin
 * 	ID			PA10							PB12						ID pin, used on F4 and F429 discovery boards, not needed if you don't like it
 *	VBUS		PA9								PB13						VBUS pin, used on F4 and F429 discovery board for activating USB chip.
 *																			You have to use VBUS on discovery boards, but on nucleo, it's ok with only Data+ and Data- pins
 * Disable necessary pins
 *
 * USB technically needs only Data+ and Data- pins.
 * Also, ID pin can be used, but it is not needed.
 *
 * Disable ID PIN
 *
 * If you need pin for something else, where ID is located, you can disable this pin for USB.
 * Add lines below in your defines.h file:
 *
 * 	//Disable ID pin
 * 	#define USB_HID_HOST_DISABLE_ID
 *
 * Disable VBUS PIN
 *
 * VBUS pin is located on Discovery boards, to activate USB chip on board.
 * If you are working with Discovery boards, then you need this pin, otherise USB will not work.
 * But if you are working on other application (or Nucleo board), you only need Data+ and Data- pins.
 * To disable VBUS pin, add lines below in your defines.h file:
 *
 * 	//Disable VBUS pin
 * 	#define USB_HID_HOST_DISABLE_VBUS
